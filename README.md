# hello-world
==============

This is my first git repo. I am setting this up because I am working on a project for a class called developing internet systems and services. Unfortunately, the other members of my group do not believe in version control, and as such they continue to overwrite and blow away each other's hard work. In an effort to stop this non-sense, I have chosen to teach myself the power of the "GITHUB". 

Thanks!
